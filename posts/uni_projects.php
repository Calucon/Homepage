            This project was part of the "Mixed Reality: Advanced Topics" course. Working in a group of two, we focused on a locomotion technique in which users actively walk within their predefined play area. As the space in the physical world is finite, people came up with the idea of redirecting the person's movement to enable infinite walking in the physical space. Therefore we implemented three different redirection techniques:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <strong>Freeze and Turn</strong><br />
            When the player is about to leave the play area the application will pause and is asked to turn around. After turning around the player can continue walking forward in the virtual world whereas they did turn around by e.g. 180Â° in the physical world.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <strong>Rotation/Curvature Gain</strong><br />
            The goal of this technique is to be very subtle. When taking a step forward or backward, the virtual world will rotate around the player. This temps the person to walk in a circle in the real world because they want to follow the path in the virtual world.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <strong>Architecture Manipulation</strong>
            This redirection technique heavily influences the level design. Our goal was to provide a virtual environment where the user had to walk through multiple doors. Whenever the user was distracted by opening or closing a door, the world would simultaneously rotate around them.
